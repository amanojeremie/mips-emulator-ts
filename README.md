# MIPS(1) Emulator - Typescript
I made a MIPS Emulator in C++ but there was no way to showcase it online.
Here's a rewrite written in Typescript with an accompanying basic assembler.
Check out the live demo [here.](https://www.jeremieamano.com/dev/mips)
## Building
- Install npm
- `npm install -g gulp`

## TODOs
- Add missing instructions (Branch Instructions, Mulitply and Divide)
- Add Floating Point support
- Labels and Data support for the assembler
